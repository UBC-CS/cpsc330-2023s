**Tutorials and office hours**:
For tutorial and office hours time and locations check the [Calendar](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330/blob/master/docs/calendar.html). The tutorials for this class will be run by the TAs and will be in office hours format. The tutorials are **optional**. That said, you will have more one-on-one time with the TAs and you are likely learn more about machine learning in general if take advantage of this.

**Post-lecture office hours**:
Both the instructor and TA(s) will be present during the post-lecture office hours (which are after each class in the same classroom). During the post-lecture office hours:
- For conceptual questions regarding materials covered in lectures, talk to the instructor.
- For questions regarding assignments or technical issues, talk to the TA(s).

## Registration

**Waitlists**:

The general seats available in this class usually fill up very quickly. Once the general seats are taken, the only way to register for the course is to sign up for the waiting list. For questions about the waiting list policies, see [here](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/courses/waitlists). You should sign up for the waiting list even if it is long; a lot of students tend to drop courses. Signing up for the waiting list also makes it more likely that we will open up extra sessions, expand class sizes, or offer additional courses on these topics. I have no control over the situation and I cannot help you bypass the waiting list.

**Prerequisites**: The official prerequisites can be found [here](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?tname=subj-course&course=330&campuscd=UBC&dept=CPSC&pname=subjarea). If you do not meet the prerequisites, see [here](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/courses-deadlines/prerequisites) and [here](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/courses-deadlines/rules-about-cpsc-appeals-undergraduate-students). I was told that students should not visit the front desk in the CS main office about prerequisite issues, because the folks at the front desk do not have the authority to resolve prerequisite issues.

In practice, the prerequisite is familiarity with Python programming.

**Auditing**: If the course is full, we cannot accommodate official auditors. If there is space and you would like to audit the course, please contact the instructor. All UBC students are welcome to audit the course unofficially. 

## Grading scheme
 
The grading scheme for the course is as follows:

| Component   | Weight          | Location   |
|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| Syllabus quiz |   1%          | [Canvas](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/101888) | 
| iClicker   |   2% | iClicker (TBA) |
| Assignments |     20%         | [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.ca/courses/5032) |
| Midterm*   |     25%         | [Canvas](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/78046)     |
| Final*     |     52%         | [Canvas](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/78046)     |

*In order to pass the course, you must pass at least one of: (1) the final exam, or (2) a weighted average of the midterm and final exam.

### iClicker
Here are a few points regarding iClicker:
- 1% participation, 1% correctness
- Exemptions will not be granted for missed iClickers under any circumstances. 
- You may fully discuss any and all iClicker questions in class with your classmates, with no restrictions.  However, you may not submit iClicker answers on behalf of your neighbors under any circumstances.

### Assignments

The plan is that most of the assignments will contribute equally towards the overall Assignments grade. However, this is not finalized yet. For example, the last assignment ends up particularly short or long due to timing. Furthermore, I will drop your lowest homework grade. **By default, late submissions will not be accepted.** The rationale is that we will be posting the solutions shortly after the assignment deadline, and we cannot accept submissions after the solutions are posted. I do not like this, but I believe the overall policy is best for the class as a whole. See [this document](homework_instructions.md) for more detailed instructions on submitting homework assignments. 

For the full policy on grades, see [this document](grades.md). I understand that grades are important for you for several reasons. But try not to focus too much on them. You will have a better learning experience and in general, you'll be happier in life if you focus more on learning the material well. For the grading scheme I wish we could use [this](https://youtu.be/HdHlfiOAJyE?t=3771).


### Midterm

Check the [Calendar](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330/blob/master/docs/calendar.html) for midterm date and time. More details about the midterm will be announced on Piazza closer to the exam time.

**Missed midterm exam**. There is no makeup midterm exam. If you miss the midterm exam, or anticipate missing the midterm exam, please see the Academic concessions section below. In most cases, if you have missed the midterm exam for a justified reason, the weight of the midterm component of the course will be transferred to the final exam.

### Final exam

The final exam will be held during the exam period. More details about the midterm will be announced on Piazza closer to the exam time.

Both midterm and final exams will be in-person but online with a BYOD (bring your own device) policy.

## Academic concessions

UBC has a [policy on academic concession](https://senate.ubc.ca/sites/senate.ubc.ca/files/downloads/20190515_V_135_Academic_Concession-Approved.pdf) for cases in which a student may be unable to complete coursework. According to this policy, grounds for academic concession can be illness, conflicting responsibilities, or compassionate grounds. Examples of compassionate grounds, from the above policy, include "a traumatic event experienced by the student, a family member, or a close friend; an act of sexual assault or other sexual misconduct experienced by the student, a family member, or a close friend; a death in the family or of a close friend." If you would like to request an academic concession, please fill out the [academic concession form](https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330/blob/master/docs/ConcessionForm.pdf), clearly specify what kind of concession are you asking for, and email it to the course coordinator as soon as possible. You may be asked for further documentation. We will evaluate the situation and make a decision on whether to grant the concession and, if so, how to proceed.

## Code of conduct

- If you plan to engage in non-course-related activity in lecture (Facebook, YouTube, chatting with friends, etc), please sit in the last two rows of the room to avoid distracting your classmates.
- Do not distribute any course materials (slides, homework assignments, solutions, notes, etc.) without permission.
- Do not photograph or record lectures (audio or video) without permission.
- If you commit to working with a partner on an assignment, do your fair share of the work.
- If you have a problem or complaint, let the instructor(s) know immediately. Maybe we can fix it!

## [Covid Safety at UBC](https://srs.ubc.ca/covid-19/ubc-campus-rules-guidance-documents/#COVID-19%20Campus%20Rules)

Please read [Covid Campus Rules](https://srs.ubc.ca/covid-19/ubc-campus-rules-guidance-documents/#COVID-19%20Campus%20Rules).  

**Masks:** This class is going to be in person. UBC no longer requires students, faculty and staff to wear non-medical masks, but continues to recommend that masks be worn in indoor public spaces.  

**Your personal health:**
If you are ill or believe you have COVID-19 symptoms or been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 use the [Thrive Health](https://bc.thrive.health/covid19/en) self-assessment tool for guidance, or download the [BC COVID-19 Support App](https://welcome.thrive.health/bc-covid19-app) for iOS or Android device and follow the instructions provided. Follow the advice from [Public Health](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/covid-19/info/restrictions).

Stay home if you have recently tested positive for COVID-19 or are required to quarantine. You can check [this website](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/self-isolation#Who) to find out if you should self-isolate or self-monitor. 
 
Your precautions will help reduce risk and keep everyone safer. In this class, the marking scheme is intended to provide flexibility so that you can prioritize your health and still be able to succeed:
- All course notes will be provided online.
- All homework assignments can be done and handed in online.
- All exams will be held online. (But you need to be present in the classroom to write the exam unless there is a legitimate reason for not doing so.)
- There are pre-watch [videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1hTcS5ZE4w&list=PLHofvQE1VlGtZoAULxcHb7lOsMved0CuM) to facilitate hybrid learning.
- There will be at least a few office hours which will be held online.


Here are some ground rules:
- If you are unable to submit a deliverable on time, please reach out **before** the deliverable is due.
- If you need extra support, the teaching team is here to work with you. Our goal is to help each of you succeed in the course.
- If you are struggling with the material or anything else, please reach out. I will try to find time and listen to you empathetically.
- If I am unable to help you, I might know someone who can. UBC has some [great student support resources](https://students.ubc.ca/support).


## Land Acknowledgement

UBC’s Point Grey Campus is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the xwməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam) peple. The land it is situated on has always been a place of learning for the Musqueam people, who for millennia have passed on their culture, history, and traditions from one generation to the next on this site.

It is important that this recognition of Musqueam territory and our relationship with the Musqueam people does not appear as just a formality. Take a moment to appreciate the meaning behind the words we use:

**TRADITIONAL** recognizes lands traditionally used and/or occupied by the Musqueam people or other First Nations in other parts of the country.

**ANCESTRAL** recognizes land that is handed down from generation to generation.

**UNCEDED** refers to land that was not turned over to the Crown (government) by a treaty or other agreement.

As you begin your journey at UBC, take some time to learn about the history of this land and to honour its original inhabitants.
