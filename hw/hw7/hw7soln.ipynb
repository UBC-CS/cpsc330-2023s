The similarity scores make sense. The similarity between _coast_ and _shore_ is on the lower side. This might be the case because these words are not frequently occurring words. Note the high similarity score between _old_ and _new_. When we think of similarity, we usually think of synonyms. But the model is not able to distinguish between synonyms vs. antonyms. When words occur in similar contexts, they are similar according to the model.    \n",

    "### 2.1 Preprocessing using [spaCy](https://spacy.io/)\n",
    "rubric={points:8}\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you'll prepare the data for topic modeling using [spaCy](https://spacy.io/). Preprocessing is a crucial step before training an LDA model and it markedly affects topic modeling results. So let's carry out preprocessing. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Your tasks:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Write code to carry out preprocessing of the \"text\" column in the dataframe above and store the preprocessed text in a new column called \"text_pp\" in the dataframe. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is no such thing as \"perfect\" preprocessing. You'll have to make your own judgments and decisions on which tokens are more informative and which ones are less informative for the given task. Some common text preprocessing steps for topic modeling are: \n",
    "- getting rid of slashes or other weird characters\n",
    "- sentence segmentation and tokenization      \n",
    "- getting rid of urls and email addresses\n",
    "- getting rid of other fairly unique tokens which are not going to help us in topic modeling  \n",
    "- excluding stopwords and punctuation \n",
    "- lemmatization        \n",
    "\n",
    "You might have to go back and forth between the preprocessing and topic modeling and interpretation steps in the next exercises. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Check out [these available attributes](https://spacy.io/api/token#attributes) for `token` in spaCy which might help you with preprocessing. \n",
    "\n",
    "> You can also get rid of words with specific POS tags. [Here](https://spacy.io/api/annotation/#pos-en) is the list of part-of-speech tags used in spaCy. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that preprocessing the corpus might take some time. So here are a couple of suggestions: 1) During the debugging phase, work on a smaller subset of the data. 2) Once you're done with the preprocessing part, you might want to save the preprocessed data so that you don't run the preprocessing part every time you run the notebook. \n"

Well I got to looking in my law dictionary and I found that a \"person\" might also be an artificial entity that is created by government and has no rights under the federal constitution. So, what I don't understand is how a statute like 922 can be enforced on an individual. So someone tell me how my government can tell me what I can or cannot possess. Just passing a law does not make it LAW. Everyone knows that laws are constitional until it goes to court. So, has it ever gone to court, not just your run of the mill \"Ok I had it I am guilty, put me in jail\" Has anyone ever claimed that they had a right to possess and was told by the Supreme Court that they didn't have that right? \n",

The line passing through this center perpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center of the sphere. 3) Repeat with the unused point and two of the original points. This gives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere's origin. Their interection is the center of the sphere. 4) the radius is easy to compute, it's just the distance from the center to any of the original points. I'll leave the math to you, but this is a workable algorithm. :-) An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formed by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the center of the sphere. Three pairs will form three planes, intersecting at a point. This might be easier to implement.\n",

    "    - RBF SVMs: We haven't talked about it yet but RBF SVMs use a kernel trick, which corresponds to transforming the original features into a new feature space and fitting a boundary there. But it's still dividing the boundary in half so we need multiclass meta strategy here. The default strategy used in `sklearn` is one-vs.-one. See [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#multi-class-classification).   \n",
    "    - Logistic regression: Above, it's using one-vs.-rest approach to handle multi-class. In this strategy a binary model is learned for each class that tries to separate that class from all of the other classes, resulting in as many binary models as there are classes. Note that there is also a multinomial logistic regression also called as **the maxent classifier**, which is different than the ovr meta strategy we are using above.\n",
    "2. In the context of NLP and vision, training models from scratch is time consuming and resource intensive. A common practice is to download powerful pre-trained models which capture rich information about language and images and tuning these models for our specific tasks. This is called transfer learning. \n",

    "1. Run all cells in your notebook to make sure there are no errors by doing `Kernel -> Restart Kernel and Clear All Outputs` and then `Run -> Run All Cells`. \n",
    "2. Notebooks with cell execution numbers out of order or not starting from \"1\" will have marks deducted. Notebooks without the output displayed may not be graded at all (because we need to see the output in order to grade your work).\n",
    "3. Upload the assignment using Gradescope's drag and drop tool. Check out this [Gradescope Student Guide](https://lthub.ubc.ca/guides/gradescope-student-guide/) if you need help with Gradescope submission. \n",
    "4. Make sure that the plots and output are rendered properly in your submitted file. If the .ipynb file is too big and doesn't render on Gradescope, also upload a pdf or html in addition to the .ipynb so that the TAs can view your submission on Gradescope. "
